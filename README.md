## 2. Challenge
To train for an upcoming marathon, Johnny goes on long runs each Saturday.
He tracks the kilometers he runs each Saturday.
If the distance run one Saturday exceeds the distance run the previous
Saturday, he calls that a "progress day".

Create a function that takes an array of the amount of kilometers Johnny ran on 
different Saturdays within a certain period, and returns Johnny's total number 
of progress days from that period.

### 2.1. Examples
```js

progressDays([4, 4, 3, 4]) // returns 1
progressDays([6, 5, 3, 4]) // returns 1
progressDays([10, 11, 12, 9, 10]) // returns 3

```
